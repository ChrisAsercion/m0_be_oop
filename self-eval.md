# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - For me, this was a big leap. But upon finishing these projects I look back at how much I have learned and applied.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    -I have to remind myself to take more breaks to be refresh.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    -I learned the things are accumulative. Everything grows on itself.
